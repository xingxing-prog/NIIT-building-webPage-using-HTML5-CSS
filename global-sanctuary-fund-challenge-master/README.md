# Global Sanctuary Fund Challenge

## Context

The Organization yet don't have a Web Presence because of which they are not able to reach a wider audience and accomplish the mission. **Having a Web Presence, would increase the monetary contribution towards the Global Sanctuary Fund and would encourage voluntary participation from individuals**. Also, the millennials are most active in providing support to the organization. Hence, the organization is very keen on reaching the millennials with the information in the best possible way such that the information is ***well presented and organized***.

As a Frontend Developer, you would have to create a Web Page to showcase all the WildLife Conservation services by laying out information in a way that is quickly usable and readable to help GSF reach a wider audience.

### Facts
1. According to a survey, 831 million millennials representing one quarter of the world’s population
2. Each millennial spends around 7.2 hours each day using different websites and mobile applications.
2. On an average these Millennials spend around 12 seconds each page. 
3. Google shares that a new user spends only 3 seconds on a site to find what he wants, and hops on to another.

## Problem Statement
**Create a Web Page which resembles the image below to achieve GSF's Mission.**
